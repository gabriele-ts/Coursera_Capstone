    "To perform all the analisys and give an answer to our problem, we need to rely on some data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- First of all, we need to obtain the house prices' for each area of Milan. For this aim, we need to web scrape data from [**immobiliare.it**](https://www.immobiliare.it/mercato-immobiliare/lombardia/milano/), an italian platform for publishing and searching for real estate ads.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *Zone:* Neighborhoods in each area\n",

    "    \n",
    "    *Affitto:* Average rent price per square meters in each area (we aren't use this variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, to obtain the geo location of each neighborhood we use **ArcGIS API**. Part of the Esri Geospatial Cloud, ArcGIS enables to connect people, locations, and data using interactive maps. Through this API we obtain 2 new columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Latitude:* Latitude for each neighborhood\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *Longitude:* Longitude for each neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, we use **Foursquare API** to obtain data about different venues in each neighbourhood. Foursquare is the most trusted, independent location data platform for understanding how people move through the real world. Using this API we obtain 5 addictional columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Neighborhood:* Name of the neighborhood\n",
